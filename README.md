GEMRISER is a tiny application framework built for people who use a LAMP stack. GEMRISER aims to be as simple as possible to set up and use.

## Requirements

* PHP 5.1 or greater
* MySQL 4.1.2 or greater
* The mod_rewrite Apache module

## Installation

* Download GEMRISER and extract
* Navigate to `application/config/config.php` and fill in your `base_url`
